/**
 * Xaero's World Map bridge (issue #223, docs/planning/xaero-map-bridge-plan.md):
 * writes LSS-delivered LOD columns into Xaero's World Map so the map records
 * terrain far beyond vanilla render distance. Pure reflection — zero compile-time
 * dependency, zero mixins (every member the bridge touches is public in Xaero WM
 * 1.45.0, verified 26.2 ≡ 1.21.1) — following the {@code VoxyCompat}/
 * {@code MoonriseReadCompat} interop discipline: any resolve failure disables the
 * bridge with one warn (diag shows {@code state=unavailable}); runtime failures
 * latch it dead for the session after {@value #THROW_LATCH} consecutive failures;
 * LOD delivery is NEVER affected — the consumer swallows every throwable
 * ({@code Error}s included: {@code LSSApi.dispatchColumn} converts ANY escape
 * into an ingest-failure report, and a map problem must not trigger re-serves).
 *
 * <p>Two-stage pipeline (plan §2.4): the registered {@link VoxelColumnConsumer}
 * extracts a {@link XaeroTileExtractor.PreparedTile} on the LSS decode thread and
 * offers it to a bounded (count AND bytes) latest-wins queue; {@link #pump()} —
 * the shared end-of-client-tick body, MAIN CLIENT THREAD (Xaero enforces it with
 * {@code isSameThread} throws) — re-runs the native writer's gate ladder
 * verbatim, then commits under Xaero's own locks in the decompiled
 * {@code MapWriter.writeChunk} sequence, including the mandatory
 * {@code requestLoad} dance for regions Xaero hasn't loaded (fresh regions never
 * self-promote) and the set-never-clear {@code setBeingWritten} lifecycle (the
 * save path owns the reset). The drain is REGION-BUCKETED with a MEMORYLESS
 * outstanding-load window (plan §14 as reshaped by the 3-Opus fold): entries
 * group by their Xaero map region (32×32 chunks — Xaero's consent granularity),
 * loaded regions commit in clusters, and load requests go to the pending regions
 * holding the most tiles, at most {@value #MAX_OUTSTANDING_LOADS} in flight —
 * where "in flight" is recognized fresh each pump from Xaero's OWN state
 * ({@code canRequestReload_unsynced()} is false exactly while a request is
 * queued/loading/refreshing), never from a bookkeeping set that could leak
 * against the loader's dead-end outcomes. Xaero's shared load-pacing surface is
 * deliberately untouched in BOTH directions: {@code shouldAllowAnotherRegionToLoad}
 * is never consulted (it synchronizes on its own — possibly BRANCH — region, a
 * lock-order inversion against Xaero's parent-then-leaf loader thread; review
 * MAJOR, a real client deadlock), and {@code setNextToLoadByViewing} is never
 * called (the loader itself never reads it — it is purely the pacing token of
 * the four native consumers, and pointing it at a far bridge region vetoed all
 * four; left alone, native requests front-insert AHEAD of our batch, the right
 * priority). Texture rebuilds ({@code MapTileChunk.updateBuffers} — the
 * expensive half of a native write) are OURS to run, exactly like the native
 * writer's: coalesced per tile chunk by {@link #flushPendingUpdates} under the
 * same gates (plan §15, the cache-not-prepared crash). The
 * {@code setToUpdateBuffers} flag is NEVER set: Xaero's preUpload sweep consumes
 * it with no {@code isResting()} check, i.e. possibly after the region was queued
 * for cache-saving on prepared textures — the saver then throws.
 *
 * <p><b>Registration lifecycle</b> (review MAJOR): the consumer is what holds the
 * handshake's CAPABILITY_VOXEL_COLUMNS bit ({@code LSSApi.hasVoxelConsumers()}),
 * so an Xaero-only install (no Voxy) legitimately subscribes to LOD data — that
 * IS the feature. But deregistering MID-SESSION would put every arriving column
 * through the no-consumer ingest-failure path (up to 4 re-serves per position
 * before parking — a whole-disc churn for a map problem), so: registration is
 * add-only while a session may be live (init + pump), a disabled or dead bridge
 * becomes a silent no-op consumer (offers are dropped), and deregistration
 * happens ONLY at {@link #onDisconnect()} — which is also where the death latch
 * re-arms (session-scoped: one bad session must not disable the feature for the
 * whole JVM; genuine Xaero drift re-latches within {@value #THROW_LATCH}
 * commits next session).
